# Kubevious Rules Library

The **rules engine** is an extension for Kubevious to allow programmable validation and best practices enforcement for configuration and state objects in Kubernetes. Rules engine lets Kubernetes operators define validation custom rules to raise errors and warnings, beyond the built-in checks that come with Kubevious by default (like label mismatch, missing port, misused or overused objects, etc.). 

This repository is a community driven library for common rules that can be used to make Kuberentes safer to use. For detailed documentation on writing custom rules can be found [here](https://github.com/kubevious/kubevious/blob/master/docs/rules-engine.md).
